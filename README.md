# Simpleton Shell

Simpsh SIMPleton SHell is a simple stripped down shell. Instead of a scripting language, developers invoke the simpsh command by passing it arguments telling it which files to access, which pipes to create, and which subcommands to invoke. It then creates or accesses all the files and creates all the pipes processes needed to run the subcommands, and reports the processe's exit status as they exit.
